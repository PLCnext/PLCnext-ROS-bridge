# Organise the description file per bridging type
# Each type can have several pubs and subs
# The values of a given index of the 3 arrays - topics, datapaths and frequencies - are together considered when creating one topic
#  Ex: publishers.topics[1], publishers.datapaths[1] & publishers.frequencies[1] are together considered to spawn pub[1]
